I am currently a senior machine learning engineer at Petuum Inc, working on natural language processing in healthcare using deep learning.

It is a research-oriented program. I was working with Professor <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~callan/"><u>Jamie Callan</u></a> on information retrieval and web mining.
